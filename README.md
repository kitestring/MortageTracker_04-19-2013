Industry: Personal

GUI: Since this application was for personal use, I didn’t feel the need to build a GUI.

Sample Raw Data Files:
Since the raw data files contain my personal financial information, I’ve not included a raw data file.

Sample Output:
Since the output contains my personal financial information, I’ve not included a sample of the output.

Application Description:

This application breaks each mortgage payment into three categories: normal Payment, additional principal, and interest.  From that information the principal reduction can be calculated for each mortgage payment.  Each of these categories are averaged on a yearly basis to track yearly trends.  I have also created a tool that will determine the reduction of interested charged as a function of additional principal payment.  This tools helps me set goals as to how much extra principal in a given year is necessary, to reduce the interest payment by a target value.  Furthermore, this tool will project the payoff date as the extra principle amount is varied.

I do understand that these tools are available online or via Quicken, but this gave me the opportunity to customize it to my liking as well as sharpen my data analytic skills.
